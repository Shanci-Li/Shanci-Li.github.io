<div align="justify">
<p> Brexit (a portmanteau of "British exit") was the withdrawal of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU) at 23:00 GMT on 31 January 2020 (00:00 CET). The UK is the first and so far the only member state to have left the EU, after 47 years of having been a part of the union — the EU and its predecessor the European Communities (EC), which included the European Economic Community — since 1 January 1973. Actually, the United Kindom was considering about exiting the EU ever since 2016. After several referendums and negotiations between UK-EU, they finally exit the EU in early January, 2020. And the withdrawl aggrement finally came into force on 31 January 2020. </p>

<p>In our project, we would like to dive into quotations talking about the Brexit and analyze information behind these quotations to learn about people's attitude through the whole event.</p>

The outcome of Brexit’s referendum was politically binding on Theresa May despite her having campaigned against leaving the EU.

</div>
<div align="justify"><p>
	It's also very interesting to analyze where do speakers talking about the Brexit come from. This gives us information on people from which country cares about the Brexit.
</p></div>
{% include_relative _includes/Nationality.html %}
<div align="justify"><p>
	After visualizing the top 20 nations talking about the Brexit, it's obvious that most of speakers talking about the Brexit came from dominant countries in the world, for example, the United Kindom, the United States of America, Australia and so on. As this event, Brexit, was mostly about the European situation, we can observe that most countries in the top 20 nations talking about the Brexit were from the Europe, which shows that people care about the Brexit are mostly from the Europe.

<div align="center">
	<font size="+1"><h1><b>Distribution of the Gender of the Speakers Talking about the Brexit</b></h1></font>

<!--PIE SENDERS-->
<div id="pie4"></div>
{% include_relative _includes/pie4.html %}

<div align="justify"><p>
	After analyzing the distribution of quotations based on different genders, it's obvious that most speakers pay attention to the Brexit are male. This comforms with the common sense that most people willing to talk about this kind of political event, like the Brexit.

<div align="center">

	Let's first have a look at who are the speakers talking about the Brexit most frequently.
</p></div>
<div align="justify"><p>
{% include_relative _includes/Occupation.html %}

<div align="justify"><p>
	Here you can see the distribution of the number of quotes based on different occupations. The result is obvious that politicians are the kind of people who talks most about the Brexit. This result is not surprising as this event is basically a political event, thus politicians always need to express their opinions to persuade their supporters. Other occupations, for example, journalist, writer, economist and blogger, are also occupations that are highly related with the politics. This explains why these groups of people would like to talk about the Brexit.

</p></div>
<div align="justify"><p>
{% include_relative _includes/Age.html %}
  
<div align="justify"><p>
	Here we can make the conclusion from the above plot that most people caring about the Brexit are in the range between 40 years old to above 70 years old. This can be explained by following two reasons. Firstly, most politicians or people from related fields are in this age range from 40 years old to above 70 years old. What's more, people in this age range are also more concerned about political events than younger people. As you can see, there is a very limited number of quotations come from people youger than 29 years old.

<p>These are people with whom Hillary communicate most frequently, and they are clearly politicians, colleagues of Hillary Clinton. She definitely use her personal email accounts on non-government servers and send professional emails to her colleagues during her time as the United States Secretary of State, which is a severe threat for the national security.</p>

<p>According to the FBI examination, <i>"over 100 emails containing classified information, including 65 emails deemed "Secret" and 22 deemed "Top Secret", none with classification markings. An additional 2,093 emails not marked classified were retroactively classified by the State Department."</i>(wikipedia). That's shocking.</p>

<!--RADAR-->
<img src="/img/radarplot.png" class="img-centered" style="width:70%; height=70%;">

<div align="justify">
<p>It is obvious that the Middle East is the main focus of U.S. at that time. Most of the top 20 frenquently discussed countries are from this region. However, Haiti appeares surprisingly more than 400 times in Hillary's emails but it is not really a "big" country. This is possibly because the 2009 Haiti earthquake.</p>
<p>There are also some asian, european and central america countries often appear in the emails, such as the United Kingdom, China and Haiti. Later we will analyse them in detail.</p>

<div align="justify">
As a superpower in the world, U.S. is a very important actor in international cooperations, competitions and military operations. So, there is a strong connection between international events and Hillary's emails. From above figures we can observe that, every event is followed by a peak of occurrence, which means that many Hillary's emails contain those countries involved in the event and possibly show the attitute of U.S govenment toward the event. Therefore, once these emails leaked to hostile countries, there could be serious threats to U.S. and its allies.

<!--CHAPTER: SENTIMENT ANALYSIS-->
<div align="center">
<font size="+1"><h1><b>What does she think about these countries?</b></h1></font>
</div>

<div align="justify">
<p>Hillary was the secretary of state and responsible for diplomacy of US in the period from 2008 to 2013. Therefore, from her emails, we can find out the attitude of US in diplomatic relations with other countries. </p>

<!--POSITIVE SENTIMENTS-->
<p>Let's first look at countries with which she presents a <span style="color:#c657a7;"><b>positive tone</b></span> in her emails.</p>
</div>

{% include_relative _includes/positive_sentiment.html %}

&nbsp;

<div align="justify">
<p>The Hilary's emails are within the period from 2008 to 2013, so we will associate US's policy and international events to the sentiments of Hilary's emails. We highlight some countries and regions here:</p>

<p><b>China</b>:
Obama was friendly with China during his presidency, and as a result, the bilateral relationship between China and US, two superpower in the world, maintains more or less stable in this period. For example, at the end of 2014, the US government carried out for the first time a 10-year visa policy to promote communication between the two countries. Meanwhile, after the 2008 international financial crisis, US was strongly influenced and wanted to recover it by strengthening cooperation in economics with China.</p>

<p><b>India</b>: 
India, as the largest democracy country in population, has always maintained a closed bilateral relations with US and has widely communication and cooperation in economics and technology with US.</p>

<p><b>Oman</b>:
Oman is a Middle East country with abundant oil reserve and the fortress country of the Strait of Hormuz, which attracts the attention of US government. And US and Oman launched negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement that were successfully concluded in October 2005. So the bilateral relation is positive and stable. </p>  

<p><b>Haiti</b>:
Haiti suffered a serious earthquake in January 2010. President Obama announced a 100m$ US aid package to help Haiti. We think that the emails mentioning Haiti are about supporting Haiti.</p>

<p><b>Russia</b>:
The Crimean Crisis happened in 2014, and the tension was only after the crisis. Before the crisis Russia and US had kept cooperation.</p>

<p><b>Japan, Brasil, Hongkong, ... </b>:
Those are countries or region which are important economies and have no big conflit with US. So we think that emails mentioning these countries talk especially about cooperation.</p>

<p><b>Qatar, Turkey, ... </b>:
These Middle-east countries had no economic or political conflit with US at that period and US do need cooperation with countries with abundant oil reserve and alliance countries in the Middle-east area.</p>
</div>

&nbsp;

After analysis about the bilateral relations with some typical countries or region, we find that the positive sentiment countries have the following properties:
- Long-term friendly country by historical reasons
- Important fortress country in channel or other transportation line
- Country with abundant oil reserve
- Economically cooperative country without conflict of interest

<div align="center">
	<font size="+1">____________________</font>
</div>
&nbsp;

<p>Now let's also look at countries with which she presents a <span style="color:#253366;"><b>negative tone</b></span> in her emails.</p>

{% include_relative _includes/negative_sentiment.html %}

&nbsp;

<!--NEGATIVE SENTIMENT-->
<div align="justify">
<p>Same as for the positive sentiment countries, we highlight the following countries to analyze:</p>

<p><b>North Korea</b>: North Korea conducted two nuclear explosion tests during this period, respectively in May 2009 for the first time ever in the history and February 2013 for the second time. The US government claimed that the test will affect international security and strongly opposed this kind of test. So sentiment in emails to North Korea is negative in this period of time. </p>

<p><b>Libya</b>: In 2012, when Benghazi, the base camp of the opposition force, is almost occupied by the Gaddafi government, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Benghazi_attack">Benghazi attack</a> took place and the US ambassador to Libya was killed, This caused a serious consequence: the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution and US, together with United Kingdom and France, bombed Libya by air force. Hillary, as the Secretary of State during this period, mostly took charge of US diplomacy, so her emails mentioning Libya must had been with negative sentiments, as it was a serious international incident.</p>

<p><b>Germany, United Kingdom, France ... </b>: These are major countries in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) which participated the action to bomb Libya. The cooperation at this level certainly talked about negative subject as NATO is a military alliance.</p>
</div>

&nbsp;

After analysis about the bilateral relations with some typical countries, we find that countries with which Hillary had a negative sentiment all have one of the following properties:
- Country in NATO taking the same position with US
- Country with an unstable government or with an difficult political situation

<!--CHAPTER: CONCLUSITON-->
&nbsp;

<div align="center">
<font size="+1"><h1><b>Conclusion</b></h1></font>
</div>

<div align="justify">
By explorating Hillary Clinton's emails, we conclude that: <br>

<ul>
- Hillary sends professional emails to her colleagues via her personal email account on non-government servers during her tenure as Secretary of State.<br>
- The keywords and topics in Hillary’s emails are associated with the international events.<br>
- The sentiment to other countries shown in her emails can reflect the national strategy of U.S. and may influence bilateral diplomatic relations. <br>
</ul>

<p>The above findings make us think that using personal emails for discussing international affaires may <b>cause severe consequences to the national security and diplomacy.</b></p>

<p>It is almost unimaginable how come a politician at her position can be that inprudent. Her "little" mistake may, in the worst case, <b>cause all people of her country in trouble</b>. The image, not only of Hillary's, but also of "American politicians" in general, is worsened from an outside point of view. </p>

<p><b>Surely that we hope to see a transparent world, but when something is related to confidential information concerning the national security, it should be prudently treated.</b></p>
